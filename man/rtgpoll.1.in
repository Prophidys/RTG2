.SH NAME
.I rtgpoll
\- RTG SNMP polling daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtgpoll
\-t file [options]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rtgpoll
queries SNMP-capable devices and inserts the results of these 
queries into a MySQL database.  The poller reads a fixed-format
target file, randomizes the targets and maintains a set number
of queries in flight.  
.I rtgpoll
optionally reads a configuration file to modify run-time
parameters.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.IR "\-t file"
Target file.  See target file section below for additional details.
.TP
.IR "\-c file"
Configuration file.  See configuration file section below for additional 
details.
.TP
.IR "\-d"
Disable database inserts.
.TP
.IR "\-m"
Skip checking for multiple instances.
.TP
.IR "\-z"
Force database insertion of zero deltas.
.TP
.IR "\-v"
Increase verbosity by one level.  Four verbosity levels exist 
(in increasing order): Off, Low, High, Debug.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.PP
.br
All RTG programs attempt to find an rtg.conf file in the following
path order:
.PP
1. ./rtg.conf
.br
2. /usr/local/rtg/etc/rtg.conf
.br
3. /etc/rtg.conf
.PP
If rtgpoll or rtgplot cannot find an rtg.conf file in any of these 
paths, it will attempt to create one in the current working directory.
Most users maintain a master rtg.conf file customized for their 
environment.  rtg.conf contains the following configurable fields:
.PP
  Interval         300
.br
  HighSkewSlop     3.0
.br
  LowSkewSlop      0.5
.br
  OutOfRange       93750000000
.br
  SNMP_Ver         1
.br
  SNMP_Port        161
.br
  DB_Host          localhost
.br
  DB_Database      rtg
.br
  DB_User          snmp
.br
  DB_Pass          rtgdefault
.br
  Threads          5
.PP
Interval is the time between successive polls of the target list, default
is 300 seconds (5 minutes).  HighSkewSlop defines the maximum number of
Intervals allowed between two consecutive poll values before the time in
seconds between said points is deemed too large to calculate a valid rate.
With the default Interval and HighSkewSlop values, that time would be 300
* 3 (15 minutes).  LowSkewSlop defines the minimum number of Intervals
alloweed between two consecutive poll values before the time in seconds
between said points is deemed two low to calculate a valid rate.  With the
default Interval and LowSkewSlop values, that time would be 300 * 0.5 (2.5
minutes).  OutOfRange defines an upper bound above which rtgpoll will never
attempt an insert into the database. OutOfRange should be a multiple of
the maximum number of bytes possible in the defined Interval for your
highest speed link.  The default OutOfRange value will suffice in most
installations.  OutOfRange may be specified on a per OID basis in
the TARGET FILE. OOR values are inserted after the interface ID and before the
description. The default value entered by rtgtargmkr.pl is basically the
interface's ifSpeed value multiplied by the Interval specified in rtg.conf.
Legal values for OOR are 30 or less numeric characters. SNMP_Ver specifies the
SNMP version the poller will use.
The number of threads rtgpoll will use is defined in the variable Threads.

Variables in rtg.conf must match the names above exactly.  Comments
and blank lines are allowed and the ordering of variables in rtg.conf
does not matter.
.PP
.SH "TARGET FILE"
.PP
The target file specifies the objects to be SNMP polled.  Comments must be
preceded with a '#' sign.  Elements in the target file are tab delimited.
The format of the target file is fixed:
.PP
  # Host  OID  64/32  Community  Table   ID   Description
.PP
where
.PP
  Host        = IP or hostname of target
.br
  OID         = Full SNMP OID, e.g. .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.10.19
.br
  64/32/0     = Specify 64/32 bit objects or 0 for gauge objects 
.br
  Community   = SNMP Community
.br
  Table       = MySQL table in the database to use
.br
  ID          = A unique ID that is used with each insert
.br
  OOR         = The maximum delta of an object's counter within one interval.
.br
  Description = Text
.PP
RTG can monitor OIDs that return a gauge value allowing one to monitor
items such as temperature, CPU, users, etc.  If an entry in the target
file has 0 (zero) specified as the OID bit width instead of 64 or 32,
the poller assumes that it is monitoring a gauge and does not attempt
to calculate an interval delta value.
.PP
rtgpoll first reads the configuration file, then the target file.  For
each SNMP poll, rtgpoll will attempt an SQL INSERT of the form:
.PP
  INSERT INTO Table VALUES (ID, NOW(), bigint)
.PP
Where Table is the name of the database table and ID is an integer.  Both
Table and ID come from the target list, NOW() is the current timestamp and
bigint is the delta value between successive SNMP polls.
.PP
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
rtgpoll accepts a number of signals.  SIGHUP forces a reload of the target
file.  If rtgpoll is actively polling, the target file is reloaded when
rtgpoll becomes idle.  This is useful when automating the target list
creation based on your active network.  SIGUSR1 increases the verbosity of
a running rtgpoll; SIGUSR2 decreases the verbosity.
