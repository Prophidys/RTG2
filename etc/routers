# This file parsed by rtgtargmkr.pl to generate an RTG target list.
# Place DNS names or IP addresses of devices which RTG will monitor
# in this file.
#
# OLD_FORMAT:
# To specify a non-default community, add a colon
# and the community name immediately after the device name.
# rtgtargmkr.pl uses 32bits by default, add a colon and "64" 
# immediately after the community to specify bits.
#
#  e.g.        device:community:bits
#
# NEW_FORMAT:
# Only the router needs to be listed, but 32|64 may be specified for bits,
# 1|2 may be used for snmpver, and a valid community string may also be
# specified. Defaults for bits and community are in rtgtargmkr.pl,
# and the default for SNMP_Ver can be specified in rtg.conf.
# 
#  e.g.        device:bits:snmpver:community
#
# Only one format is allowed.
