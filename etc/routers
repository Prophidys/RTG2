# Only the router needs to be listed, but 32|64 may be specified for bits,
# 1|2 may be used for snmpver, and a valid community string may also be
# specified. Defaults for bits and community are in rtgtargmkr.pl,
# and the default for SNMP_Ver can be specified in rtg.conf.

#rtr-1.my.net:32:1:foobar
#rtr-2.my.net:64:2
#rtr-3.my.net
