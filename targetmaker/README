NOTE: you must use rtgpoll with the -z option for graphs of extended
interfaces to display properly.

targetmaker-0.8.5.tar.gz
* many many bug fixes
* significant speed improvements in php code
* significant speed improvement in target creation code
* added ability to view by date in view.php
* made new API calls for modules that modules should follow (will
  be documented at some point.
* targetmaker now has the ability to store all config values in a
  database table. This allows you to re-run targetmaker on a routers
  file with only a few entires which will update the values in teh datbase
  and recreate the targets.cfg file with all the hosts. Perfect to use if
  you have a large number of hosts, but only need to requery one or two for
  changed configs and don't want to requery everything or edit the targets 
  file manually.
* Other features that I have forgotten...

targetmaker-0.8.tar.gz
* bug fixes for targetmaker
* including createtargets.sh file to run from cron to update targets 
  file using findsnmp_hosts and restart rtgpoll 
* major changes to the view.php application
  * all viewable options should now be functioning.
  * ability to view stats for multiple interfaces on the same graph 
    (MIB Objects section)
  * Internationalization support has been added, but is currently only
    useful if you speak English or piglatin.
  * Theme support if you don't like my choice of color/font scheme
    you can make up your own
  * Many use chooseable configuration options
  * Seperate view.cfg file for the administrator to define option choices
    that users can choose from
  * Business View that shows graphs during "Business Hours" (definable)
  * Ability to offset the viewing time by X number of days. You can now have
    view.php show graphs as if you were looking at them yesterday, or last 
    week. This is very useful with the Business View.
  * Allows configuration of refresh value (useful to stop screens from refreshing
    before fully drawn on hosts with very large numbers of graphs with slow 
    databases on the back end.
  * "Compression Threshold" allows the view to be "compressed" for stats that 
    have a large number of interfaces. Instead of having to draw graphs for 50 
    ethernet interfaces on a switch on the main host page for the device it will
    just give you a text name of the interface as a link to see the graphs. This
    makes viewing of large enterprise switches possible in a sane amount of time.
* other changes and fixes to numerous to mention.

targetmaker-0.7.tar.gz
* quick interim release, not wide distribution


targetmaker-0.6.1.tar.gz

Whats new with 0.6.1:
* Added findsnmp_hosts application which will create a routers file
  based off a config file of hosts and networks to scan
* Bug fixes, bug fixes, and more bug fixes

Whats new with 0.6:
* Many many bug fixes
* We now have view.php, which is an MRTG like interface for viewing graphs of
  hosts. This is sorta based off the view.php from RTG.
* targetmaker now creates an "interface" for the host which holds its sysDescr value. 
* targetmaker.cfg file is now distributed as targetmaker.cfg.dist
* moved to use CVS for versioning, all versions and logs of files
  were reset in this process.


Whats New with 0.5:
* Added in a tables to hold module graphing information
* Create a PHP interface called targetmaker.php based off of RTG's
  rtg.php
* Moved all config variables to a seperate file as the number was
  getting to large to easily keep in the main file.
* Added support for Network Appliance filers
* many bug fixes

Whats NEW with 0.4:
* Added in ability to use all modules, or just use standard stats
  that the default rtgtargmkr.pl uses via $EXTENDEDMODE variable.
  Set $EXTENDEDMODE to 1 to enable all modules, or 0 to just use
  StandardIf.pl
* Changed name to targetmaker to avoid further confusion with the
  default rtgtargmkr.pl command
* Added support for 0.8 style targets file
* Added support for SNMP version (thanks John Payne)
* Added support for command line options (thanks John Payne)
* Fixed SQL query in View.pm that resulted in full table scans
* Fixed Catalyst support for ethernet interfaces
* Added support for alternate MySQL table types
* Fixed index naming issue for some target types
* Added disk support for HOST-RESOURCE-MIB


Whats NEW with 0.3:
Alot :)
* Moved standard interfaces to their own module
* Added module for Extreme switches (very limited)
* Added module for SNMP-Informant information
* Added module for HOST-RESOURCE-MIB information
* Added order.cfg file to modules to handle order processing
* Added "classes" so that when a host supports stats in multiple modules it 
only adds a specific class of stats once. (ie. only cpu from NetSNMP, not also
from HOST-RESOURCE-MIB)
* Various changes to all modules to support classes
* Various bug fixes to modules and logic
* Removed need to defile table_* variables in View.pm as the standard network
information is now in a module
* Updated View.pm to show what modules it is showing stats from
* Other things I've forgotten


Whats NEW with 0.2.1:
This is the latest update of the rtgtargmkr.pl script with modules support. 
There have been a number of bug fixes since the last release. The most
notable change is the addition of %table_map and %table_options variables
to the modules. These are need for use by the new perl module for displaying 
graphs of the data generated from the script. The perl module is named 
RTG::View.pm, and it requires mod_perl in apache to run. It has only been 
tested on Apache 2.0 with mod_perl 1.99. The additions that were added to
my httpd.conf file are below. The View.pm module does require access to the
rtgmodules directory, as it parses the modules in able to get the required 
information to create the graphs. Once again, as before, this data is being 
stored outside of MySQL as to not interfere with the current database schema, 
or any future changes to the database schema. In addition View.pm does pay 
attention to the active/inactive status field of the interface table. The 
format and setup of the output of View.pm is very similiar to mrtg-rrd.cgi 
if you are familiar with that application for use with MRTG.

The modules is accessed via HTTP by the following mechinisms:
http://rtg.server/rtg	- will give list of all machines with stats
http://rtg.server/rtg/hostname	- gives 24 hour graphs of all stats for hostname
http://rtg.server/rtg/hostname/MIBII-netio	- give all graphs for hostname 
	of type MIBII-netio (this translates to ifInOctets and ifOutOctets)
http://rtg.server/rtg/hostname/MIBII-netio/20	- give 24hour, 7day, 30 day, and
365 day historical graphs of hostname for stats MIBII-netio on interface 20.

I'll attempt to give any help I can, but I can't guarantee anything :) This
software, and any updates will be available at
